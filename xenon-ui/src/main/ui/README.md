# Introduction

Xenon UI is built for one purpose: make your Xenon development experience MUCH better. It provides a rich set of features that can help you:
- Debug your Xenon-based system by organizing various documents and visualizations them in a meaningful way.
- Navigate to any node within the node group and browse node-specific document contents.
- Make REST calls with test payloads.
- Generate query tasks interactively.
- Trace operations.
- Extract logs that are specific to each node.

The application is still in its early stage of development and is expected to iterate/change rapidly.

#### Availability

Xenon UI comes as a web application with every Xenon jar after 0.9.5 and is available in /core/ui/default. In future we will also consider distribute it as a standalone desktop application.

#### Available Features

- Node Selector: displays all the peer nodes and their system info in the current group, and you can select a specific node so the UI shows all the information relevant to this node.
- Dashboard: shows stats for CPU, Memory and Disk usage, and logs.
- Lists all the available factory services and their status and options, as well as detailed information of service instances under the factory services.
- Create, Edit(PATCH/PUT) and Delete instances.
- Logs for each node.
- Query UI that allows building queries using either the interactive "Query Builder" or JSON editor, and displays the results right below.
- Login/logout mechanism.
- Conceptual about page, we can either create a page like this with documentations or point the ? icon to xenon wiki (which would be easier).
- (PARTIAL) i18n support

#### Planned Improvements

- Operation Tracing.
- Pagination: not implemented for any of the lists, which will cause performance issue when it scales. Need some refactoring once having a clearer idea on how Xenon does it.
- Reactive: right now data all come from one off http calls, no change will be reflected on the UI without page refresh. Need some work here.
- Node Selector: Need to cover more complex topology scenarios.
- Dashboard improvements: Aggregated service instance stats and index usage stats needs to be added to the dashboard.
- Form improvements: UX revisit and validation on Create, Edit and Delete instance model forms.
- System configuration: should allow edits of some system properties.
- Performance: definitely need some tuning.
- Improvements/fixes based on your feedback.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* node v5.x.x or higher and npm 3 or higher.

* To run the NativeScript app:

```bash
npm install -g nativescript
npm install -g typescript
```
## Usage

```bash
# install the project's dependencies
npm install
# watches your files and uses livereload by default
npm start
# api document for the app
npm run serve.docs

# dev build
npm run build.dev
# prod build
npm run build.prod
```

## NativeScript App

#### Setup

```bash
npm install -g nativescript
```

#### Dev Workflow

You can make changes to files in `src/client` or `nativescript` folders. A symbolic link exists between the web `src/client` and the `nativescript` folder so changes in either location are mirrored because they are the same directory inside.

Create `.tns.html` and `.tns.css` NativeScript view files for every web component view file you have.

#### Run

```
iOS:                      npm run start.ios
iOS (livesync emulator):  npm run start.livesync.ios
iOS (livesync device):    npm run start.livesync.ios.device

// or...

Android:                      npm run start.android
Android (livesync emulator):  npm run start.livesync.android
Android (livesync device):    npm run start.livesync.android.device
```

* Requires an image setup via AVD Manager. [Learn more here](http://developer.android.com/intl/zh-tw/tools/devices/managing-avds.html) and [here](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli#the-commands).

## Electron App

#### Develop

```
Mac:      npm run start.desktop
Windows:  npm run start.desktop.windows
```

#### Develop with livesync
```
Mac:      npm run start.livesync.desktop
Windows:  npm run start.livesync.desktop.windows
```

#### Release: Package Electron App for Mac, Windows or Linux

```
Mac:      npm run build.desktop.mac
Windows:  npm run build.desktop.windows
Linux:    npm run build.desktop.linux
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test

# Debug - In two different shell windows
npm run build.test.watch      # 1st window
npm run karma.start           # 2nd window

# code coverage (istanbul)
# auto-generated at the end of `npm test`
# view coverage report:
npm run serve.coverage

# e2e (aka. end-to-end, integration) - In three different shell windows
# Make sure you don't have a global instance of Protractor

# npm run webdriver-update <- You will need to run this the first time
npm run webdriver-start
npm run serve.e2e
npm run e2e

# e2e live mode - Protractor interactive mode
# Instead of last command above, you can use:
npm run e2e.live
```
You can learn more about [Protractor Interactive Mode here](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/debugging.md#testing-out-protractor-interactively)

## Web Configuration Options

Default application server configuration

```javascript
var PORT             = 5000;
var LIVE_RELOAD_PORT = 4002;
var DOCS_PORT        = 4003;
var APP_BASE         = '/';
```

Configure at runtime

```bash
npm start -- --port 8080 --reload-port 4000 --base /my-app/
```

#### Sync to the latest seed project changes

Due to the amount of breaking changes introduced in each Angular 2 release, please be super careful when you decide to sync to the latest changes from the [seed project](https://github.com/NathanWalker/angular2-seed-advanced), which will most likely bump up the Angular version and the underlying dependencies.

# Cut a Release

Since Xenon UI is independent from the rest of the Xenon, it has its own version and release cycle.

## Release as a web application

This is the default option which let Xenon to host the UI in /core/ui/default.

#### Produce a production build

In the current `ui` directory:

```bash
npm run build.prod
```

It should generate a `prod` folder under `dist`.

#### Clean up the old files

Go to `xenon/xenon-ui/src/main/resources/ui/com/vmware/xenon/ui/UiService`, run

```bash
rm -r *
rm -r .*
```

#### Deploy the new build

In the current `ui` directory:

```bash
cp -a dist/prod/ ../resources/ui/com/vmware/xenon/ui/UiService
```

#### Rebuild Xenon

Run `mvn clean install` under `xenon` directory

## Release as a desktop application

TBD
