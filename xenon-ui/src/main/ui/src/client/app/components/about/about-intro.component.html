            <h3>Introduction to Xenon</h3>
            <h4>Xenon Highlights</h4>
            <p>
                Xenon is a framework for writing small REST-based services. (Some people call them microservices.)
                The runtime is implemented in Java and acts as the host for the lightweight, asynchronous services.
                The programming model is language agnostic (does not rely on Java specific constructs) so
                implementations in other languages are encouraged. The services can run on a set of distributed nodes.
                Xenon provides replication, synchronization, ordering, and consistency for the state of the services.
                Because of the distributed nature of Xenon, the services scale well and are highly available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Xenon is a "batteries included" framework. Unlike some frameworks that provide just consistent data
                replication or just a microservice framework, Xenon provides both.
                Xenon services have REST-based APIs and are backed by a consistent, replicated document store.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each service has less than 500 bytes of overhead and can be paused/resumed,
                making Xenon able to host millions of service instances even on a memory constrained environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Service authors annotate their services with various service options, acting as requirements on the runtime,
                and the framework implements the appropriate algorithms to enforce them.
                The runtime exposes each service with a URI and provides utility services per instance,
                for stats, reflection, subscriptions and configuration. A built-in load balancer routes
                client requests between nodes, according to service options and plug-able node selection algorithms.
                Xenon supports multiple, independent node groups, maintaining node group state using a scalable gossip scheme.
            </p>
            <p>
                A powerful index service, invoked as part of the I/O pipeline for persisted services,
                provides a multi version document store with a rich query language.
            </p>
            <p>
                High availability and scale-out is enabled through the use of a consensus and replication algorithm and is also integrated in the I/O processing.
            </p>

            <h4>
                What can Xenon be used for?
            </h4>
            <p>
                The lightweight runtime enables the creation of highly available and scalable applications in the
                form of cooperating light weight services. The operation model for a cluster of
                Xenon nodes is the same for both on premise, and service deployments.
            </p>
            <p>
                The photon controller project makes heavy use of Xenon to build a scalable and highly available
                Infrastructure-as-a-Service fabric, composed of stateful services, responsible for configuration (desired state),
                work flows (finite state machine tasks), grooming and scheduling logic.
                Xenon is also used by several teams building new products, services and features, within VMware.
            </p>
            <h4>Other Open Source products</h4>
            <p>
                Some or most of the issues can be resolved with one or more open source products like Activiti, jBPM etc.
                which implement BPMN 2.0 spec and standard in industry. However, bringing any such products require new
                tech stack and framework which doesn't work by default with other VMware products, and may require some maturity in VMware ecosystem.
