# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT

* Renamed packages, build artifacts and various properties to
Xenon (from DCP). This is a runtime and binary breaking change
since HTTP headers, runtime properties, command line arguments
have changed.

## 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT

* Request rate limiting support using authorization subject.
New serviceHost.setRequestRateLimit method and rate tracking
logic added to ServiceHost.

* Remove Operation.joinWith and associated support code in service
client. Joins are created and sent with OperationJoin.create() and
sendWith.

* Add Claims class to common package that extends the Claims in the jwt
package to include a properties map. This can be used to carry arbitrary
session state.

* Add QueryOption.CONTINUOUS so query tasks can be used for real time
update notifications with queries spanning the entire index

* Add ServiceDocument.documentUpdateAction so each state version is
associated with the action that caused the change. Also allows
subscribers to continuous query tasks to determine if a notification
was for a deleted state. This is a breaking change, please delete
existing lucene index
