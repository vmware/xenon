# CHANGELOG

## 0.6.1-SNAPSHOT

* Add PRAGMA_FORCE_INDEX_UPDATE allowing for conflict
  resolution or overriding version checks on restarting a
  deleted service

* Fix NodeGroupBroadcastResponse race, where the jsonResponse
  list was getting corrupted, thus removing results from some
  of the nodes. This affected broadcast request behavior.

* Simplify constructs relating to consensus and availability.
  ServiceOption.ENFORCE_QUORUM is removed. Its semantics are
  rolled in with ServiceOption.OWNER_SELECTION. This implies
  that a service enabling owner selection, will get strong
  consensus and leader election, across the node group. The
  membershipQuorum must be properly set for strong consensus
  on state update.
  Eventual consistency is still supported and achieved by
  relaxing the membership quorum (using the REST api on
  node group /config suffix)
  Services with just ServiceOption.REPLICATION are always
  eventually consistent.
  Xenon will make an attempt to converge state across peers
  regardless of the options set.

* Remove NodeState.synchQuorum - Its functionality is collapsed
  into the existing membershipQuorum field. The quorum number
  determines when requests are allowed to flow, given node group
  health, and when resynchronization should occur. If the
  host argument --peerNodes is used, membership quorum is
  automatically set to the majority: (total / 2) + 1

* Services with ServiceOption.ON_DEMAND_LOAD and
  ServiceOption.REPLICATION will not automatically synchronize
  on every node group change. Services marked as such are
  expected to be explicitly synchronized or, on first use.

* Add FactoryService.create(), update ExampleService.
  Service authors no longer need to implement a factory service
  and derive from FactoryService class. Instead, they can
  just use FactoryService.create() to get a default, functional
  factory service instance which can then be started with
  ServiceHost.startService()

* Enable update of synch quorum through PATCH to
  node-groups/<group>/config. Membership quorum was already
  supported, now synch quorum is included.

* Fix consensus protocol commit behavior. Commit messages
  are no longer sent if the request to owner service fails
  or the service does not have ENFORCE_QUORUM.

* Split Service.handleDelete into Service.handleStop and
  Service.handleDelete. If the service is being stopped, the
  host has always added a special pragma, indicating this is
  a DELETE with the intent to stop a service, and to avoid
  any persistence or replication side effects.
  This is now formalized through the new handleStop method,
  invoked only when the service is being issued a DELETE, with the
  pragma included. This is potentially a breaking change for
  services that did special cleanup ONLY on stop, not delete+stop

## 0.6.0

* Add new per service utility suffix, /available. Provides a
  consistent mechanism for a service to declare it is available,
  re-using the underlying stats support. By default, all services
  that are started and in ProcessingState.AVAILABLE will return
  200 (OK) on GET /<service/available

* Add service host set/get service cache clear delay so cache clears are
  configurable

* Fixed bug: when DELETEs occurred during network partition, they
  would not be correctly synchronized after nodes rejoined.

## 0.5.1

* Enable HTTPS support for node groups. Several fixes in URI
  manipulation now allow Xenon hosts to start with just a HTTPS
  listener and use exclusively HTTPS for node group operations,
  including join, maintenance, replication and forwarding

* Add ServiceHost.Arguments.resourceSandbox to speed up UI
  development experience. When specified, xenon will publish
  the UI resource files directly from the file folder, allowing
  for real time edits / refresh of UI content

## 0.5.0

* Implement authorization on stateless services. This is a breaking
  change for xenon deployments that use authorization and have 
  non factory service implementations of StatelessService class.
  Stateless services must now be included in roles, using a resource
  specification over the document self link.

## 0.4.1

* Updated the API for backing up or restoring the index. The Bearer
  parameter is now named bearer (the capitalization changed). While
  this is a breaking change, we believe this is unused and should be
  harmless.

* Added new ServiceOption: CONCURRENT_GET_HANDLING. This is (and has
  been) the default, but can now be disabled when appropriate.

* Added SLF4J-Xenon bridge

* QueryTasks that are broadcast queries can now be direct tasks.

## 0.4.0

* Added default support for HTTP Options. StafulService and
StatelessService now return the same content as GET on
*/template suffix, providing a default self documentation
capability.

* Added honoring of verbs (POST, PATCH, etc) in roles

* Renamed authentication cookie from dcp-auth-cookie to
  xenon-auth-cookie. This should be transparent for clients that use
  cookies, but clients that extract the cookie value in order to make
  an x-xenon-auth-token header need to use this new cookie instead. 

* The basic authentication service (/core/authn/basic) now includes
  the x-xenon-auth-token header in its response, in addition to the
  cookie. 

* ExampleServiceHost now takes arguments to create users (one admin,
  one non-admin that can access example services). This enables you to
  use the ExampleServiceHost when authorization is enabled with the
  isAuthorizationEnabled flag. The new arguments are:

  - adminUser
  - adminUserPassword
  - exampleUser
  - exampleUserPassword

## 0.3.2

* Add on demand service load, enabled with
ServiceOption.ON_DEMAND_LOAD

* Upgrade to Lucene 5.3.1 from 5.2.1. The Lucene file format is
backwards compatible, so this is a transparent update.

## 0.3.1

* Indexing I/O path optimizations producing 20% throughput
increase. Removed ServiceOption.INSTRUMENTATION from
LuceneDocumentIndexService. It can be toggled through /config
at runtime.

* Referer is no longer indexed with every document update

* All Operation request and response headers are converted
to lower case before being added to request/response maps

* Tunable query limit for service load during factory service
restart and during synchronization. A large result limit will
increase the service load throughput and decrease overal time
for factory child services becoming available. Large limits
can impact memory and network utilization however.

* Add keyPassphrase command line argument for providing SSL private key
passphrase.

## 0.3.0

* Renamed ServiceOption.EAGER_CONSISTENCY to ServiceOption.ENFORCE_QUORUM

* Renamed packages, build artifacts and various properties to
Xenon (from DCP). This is a runtime and binary breaking change
since HTTP headers, runtime properties, command line arguments
have changed.

## 0.2.0

* Request rate limiting support using authorization subject.
New serviceHost.setRequestRateLimit method and rate tracking
logic added to ServiceHost.

* Remove Operation.joinWith and associated support code in service
client. Joins are created and sent with OperationJoin.create() and
sendWith.

* Add Claims class to common package that extends the Claims in the jwt
package to include a properties map. This can be used to carry arbitrary
session state.

* Add QueryOption.CONTINUOUS so query tasks can be used for real time
update notifications with queries spanning the entire index

* Add ServiceDocument.documentUpdateAction so each state version is
associated with the action that caused the change. Also allows
subscribers to continuous query tasks to determine if a notification
was for a deleted state. This is a breaking change, please delete
existing lucene index

## 0.1.1

* Service authorization.

* Basic authentication.

* Allow booleanClauses to have single clause.

* Implement sort for QueryTask.

* Add QueryFilter for in-place evaluation of query specifications against documents.

* Add support for JavaScript DCP services connected over WebSocket.

## 0.1.0

* Start of CHANGELOG. See commit history.
