Xenon Quick Start - Archetype Generator

The goal of this maven project is to maintain the code that will generate the xenon-quickstart archetype.

For ease of developing and extending the archetype, please first add files to/edit the java project in src/main/java,
using the package name "example.group". You can then build the project as normal with Maven, using commands
like "mvn test" or "mvn package".

If you add new .java files, please edit

    scripts/copy-files.sh

and add the new files to the variables at the top. If you are adding something other than a new .java file in
src/main/java or src/test/java then you will instead need to manually place it in

    src/main/resources/archetype-resources

In some cases you may need to edit

    src/main/resources/META-INF/maven/archetype-metadata.xml

which defines which files are to be made available for archetype generation. Right now the file is configured such that
you shouldn't need to edit archetype-metadata for for most use cases.

If you need to make chances to the README that the consumer of hte archetype will see or change the pom.xml file that
is included with the generated archetype, you can find them in:

    src/main/resources/archetype-resources/README.quickstart
    src/main/resources/archetype-resources/pom.xml

When you run mvn package, Maven will run the script "scripts/copy-files.sh" which will copy the files to the
"src/main/resources/archetype-resources" directory where Maven expects to find archetype files. copy-files.sh will
also replace the "example.group" string with ${groupId} string everywhere it finds it in the files that it is copying.

To generate the archetype-ready package, and install it into your local repository (~/.m2)

    mvn install

All tests are integration tests. If you want to run the tests, but not install in the local repository:

    mvn integration-test

If you add new unit tests, they will be run by the integration-test target. Currently there is one
integration-test, which runs the "integration-test" on an archetype generated by this project. If you want to run
other maven commands on the generated archetype as part of the

    src/test/resources/projects/


After you have installed it in your local repository or installed it in a remote repository to which you have access,
you can create an archetype as follows:

    mvn archetype:generate \
          -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vmware.xenon \
          -DarchetypeArtifactId=xenon-quickstart \
          -DgroupId=com.yourorg  \
          -DartifactId=xenon-quickstart \
          -DinteractiveMode=false

The archetype project also has a rule to build a jar file with all dependencies, so consumers can immediately
run their new application.

    cd xenon-quickstart
    mvn package
    java -jar target/xenon-quickstart-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
