# Contributing to Xenon

Hi, and thanks for your interest in helping out with Xenon.  More information on important concepts
you need to keep in mind when contributing to Xenon as well as specifics regarding the setup of your
development environment, how to test and submit your changes can be found in the project Wiki on
Github at https://github.com/vmware/xenon/contributing.

## Getting Started
Prior to 'diving in', there are a few book-keeping things that need to get taken care of:

* If you haven't already, now is the time to fill out our
[Contributor License Agreement](http://vmware.github.io/photon/assets/files/vmware_cla.pdf) and
return a copy to [osscontributions@vmware.com](mailto:osscontributions@vmware.com) as you will need
to do so before we can merge your contribution.
